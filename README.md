# Regional Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis (2013–2017)

## Business Problem Statement

Leadership does not have a clear, unified view of what is driving profitable growth vs. just driving volume.
Decisions about product strategy, regional investment, pricing, and channel focus are being made without a consistent analytical foundation.

Specifically:
   - Revenue fluctuates significantly month-to-month, but the causes are unclear
   - The company may be over-dependent on a small set of products, customers, and regions
   - High-revenue customers may be silently eroding margins
   - Channel strategy is volume-driven, not profit-optimized

## Executive Snapshot (What Leadership Learns)
   - The business is highly seasonal, creating revenue volatility and planning risk
   - Two products alone generate ~25% of total sales → concentration risk
   - Wholesale drives 54% of volume, but Export is the most profitable channel
   - California dominates performance → geographic dependency risk
   - Some large enterprise customers generate high revenue but weak margins
   - Profit is driven far more by pricing than by volume
