# Regional Sales Performance & Profitability Analysis (2013–2017)

## Business Problem Statement

Leadership does not have a clear, unified view of what is driving profitable growth vs. just driving volume.
Decisions about product strategy, regional investment, pricing, and channel focus are being made without a consistent analytical foundation.

Specifically:
   - Revenue fluctuates significantly month-to-month, but the causes are unclear
   - The company may be over-dependent on a small set of products, customers, and regions
   - High-revenue customers may be silently eroding margins
   - Channel strategy is volume-driven, not profit-optimized

## Executive Snapshot

   - The business is highly seasonal, creating revenue volatility and planning risk
   - Two products alone generate 25% of total sales → concentration risk
   - Wholesale drives 54% of volume, but Export is the most profitable channel
   - California dominates performance → geographic dependency risk
   - Some large enterprise customers generate high revenue but weak margins
   - Profit is driven far more by pricing than by volume

## Key Findings

- Seasonality Risk: Revenue bottoms out in April and peaks in late spring / early summer, creating cash-flow and planning instability.
- SKU Concentration: Products 25 and 26 account for ~25% of total revenue.
- Channel Tradeoff:
   - Wholesale = scale, lower margins
   - Export = smaller scale, highest margins (38%)
- Geographic Dependency:
   - California alone generates $230M and 7.6K orders
   - West region dominates; Northeast & Midwest underperform
- Customer Profitability Imbalance:
   - Some $6–9M customers are more profitable than $10M+ customers
   - Indicates discounting and pricing discipline issues
- Profit Driver:
   - Unit price is the strongest driver of profit
   - Volume has relatively weak impact on profitability
 
  
## Strategic Recommendations
- Stabilize Seasonality:
Launch April demand recovery campaigns and strengthen January sales programs.

- Optimize Product Portfolio:
Protect and scale top SKUs (25 & 26). Reprice, bundle, or retire structurally weak products.

- Rebalance Channel Strategy:
Grow Export for margin. Use Wholesale strategically for volume, not profit illusion.

- Reduce Geographic Risk:
Replicate California’s operating model in high-potential states. Invest in Northeast & Midwest.

- Enforce Margin Governance:
Flag and review low-margin enterprise deals to prevent silent margin erosion.

## Business Impact
This solution transforms fragmented reporting into a single source of truth that enables:
   - Smarter product strategy
   - More profitable growth decisions
   - Better regional and channel investment allocation
   - Proactive margin protection

## What Was Delivered
- Executive-ready Power BI dashboard (3 pages):
   - Performance Overview
   - Customer & Margin Segmentation
   - Revenue & Scenario Analysis

- Fully modeled analytics dataset
- A reusable decision-support framework for leadership

## Project Execution (Technical Overview)

This project followed a production-style analytics workflow:

1. Data Engineering & Preparation
   - Integrated sales, products, customers, regions, states, and budget tables
   - Standardized schemas, cleaned columns, engineered profit & margin features
   - Built a single analytics-ready fact dataset
   - Validated: no missing values, no duplicates

2. Feature Engineering
- Created:
   - Profit
   - Profit margin %
   - Calendar features (month, year)
   - Geographic mappings (state → region)

3. Exploratory Analysis
   - Time-series trend analysis
   - Product & customer segmentation
   - Channel profitability analysis
   - Regional performance mapping
   - Correlation & driver analysis

4. Business Intelligence Layer
   - Designed stakeholder-ready Power BI dashboards
   - Focused on:
      - Executive readability
      - Decision support
      - Drill-down analysis paths
    
## Why This Project Matters
This is not a reporting exercise. This is a decision-support system that:
   - Exposes structural revenue and margin risks
   - Shows where growth is real vs. where it is fragile
   - Enables leadership to reallocate investment with confidence

## Power BI Intereactive Dashboard:
Interactive report requires authentication due to Power BI tenant restrictions.
